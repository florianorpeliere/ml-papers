## Computer Vision

* [Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0312.pdf): New image recognition, segmentation and capturing dataset. [Link to COCO Dataset](http://mscoco.org/home/)
  * Image annonation with Amazon's Mechanical Turk
  * Bounding Box Detection with DPMv5-P/DPMv5-C
* [Google research blog: Supercharge your Computer Vision models with the TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/06/supercharge-your-computer-vision-models.html): Google won COCO Detection challenge with they in-house object detection. This system is available via [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/object_detection)
* [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf): Object detection with a single deep neural network [Github Code](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd)
* [Speed/accuracy trade-offs for modern convolutional object detectors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.10012.pdf): Guide for selecting a detection architecture that achieves the right speed/memory/accuracy balance for a given application and platform. They compare SSD, Faster R-CNN and R-FCN meta-achitecture with some architecural configuation like feature extractors, Matching and Box encoding
